LAZARUS — Managed Agent driver.

Single Gemini 3.5 Flash Managed Agent (Antigravity) that migrates COBOL -> tested
Python, proves equivalence against the original COBOL (differential oracle), and
forges its own SKILL.md when it meets an unknown idiom.

Reconciled to the VERIFIED Managed Agents / Interactions API surface (see
docs/RESEARCH_MANAGED_AGENTS.md, consolidated 2026-05-23). Key facts this code
depends on:
  - SDK:               google-genai >= 2.4.0 floor (client.agents + Environment API ship in
                       2.4.0; step.* SSE in 2.0.0; output_text in 2.3.0). We pin >= 2.6.0.
  - Base agent id:     "antigravity-preview-05-2026"  (Gemini 3.5 Flash; same string for
                       agent= and base_agent=)
  - Gemini 3.x config: BREAKING — do NOT send temperature / top_p / top_k anywhere; they
                       are rejected/ignored on Gemini 3.x. The only generation knob is
                       thinking_level (str: minimal|low|medium|high; default now "medium").
                       We pass NO generation_config and rely on the "medium" default, so
                       there is nothing to break here — keep it that way.
  - Capability note:   The MANAGED-AGENT runtime does not expose function_calling,
                       structured output, mcp, computer_use, or file_search. (This is an
                       agent-runtime limitation, NOT a model limitation — the underlying
                       gemini-3.5-flash model DOES support function calling & structured
                       output; the Antigravity agent simply doesn't surface them.)
  - Create agent:      client.agents.create(id, base_agent, system_instruction, base_environment)
  - Run interaction:   client.interactions.create(agent=..., input=..., stream=...,
                       extra_body={"environment": "remote" | <env_id> | {type,sources}})
                       -> environment is passed via extra_body, NOT a top-level kwarg.
  - State threading:   reuse interaction.environment_id (files + packages persist).
                       previous_interaction_id is the MODEL path's state carrier and is
                       UNVERIFIED on the agent path, so we thread state via environment_id.
  - Streaming events:  event.event_type in {step.start, step.delta, step.stop,
                       interaction.created, interaction.completed, interaction.status_update,
                       error}; step.delta carries event.delta.text; the completed event
                       carries the final interaction (with .steps, .id, .environment_id).
  - Reading output:    iterate interaction.steps for the model_output step (the agent
                       resource has no guaranteed .output_text attr).

FORGE beat (SAFE pattern — do NOT rely on silent mid-run auto-reload of an
agent-authored SKILL.md, which is UNVERIFIED):
  1. The agent writes .agents/skills/<idiom>/SKILL.md and commits it (persists on disk
     IN THIS environment).
  2. The retry interaction REUSES the same environment_id so the file is present.
  3. The retry prompt EXPLICITLY instructs the agent to re-read .agents/skills/ before
     retrying — we never assume the forged skill is already in context.
  Persistence scope: the forged skill lives in the reused environment, NOT forever. A
  fresh agent invocation forks a clean base_environment; carrying a forged skill into
  future runs permanently means re-registering the agent with that SKILL.md mounted.
