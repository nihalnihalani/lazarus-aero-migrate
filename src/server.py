"""
LAZARUS — FastAPI + SSE bridge (browser <-> live Managed Agent).

Serves the web/ UI and drives the REAL Gemini Managed Agent (src/agent.py),
forwarding its progress to the live-trace UI as CANONICAL events
(web/STREAM_CONTRACT.md). There is NO mock here — the scripted run survives only
as the UI's `?mock=1` break-glass. With no GEMINI_API_KEY this returns an
explicit 503 (never fake data).

Endpoint contract (matches web/src/live.js, mode='canonical'):
    POST /api/migrate   { cobol, filename }     -> { run_id }
    GET  /api/stream/{run_id}                    -> text/event-stream (canonical events)
    GET  /api/download/{run_id}                  -> migrated module bytes (when available)
    GET  /api/health                             -> liveness + key/agent info

What this bridge derives from agent.py's stream — EVERY panel, two layers deep:
  * PROGRESSIVE `phase` events off the streamed step text (ingest->recover->translate
    ->oracle->test->forge->done), so the UI advances live, not only at the end.
  * `step` (live trace), enforced iteration counter, `forge` (+git additions),
    `reload`, `download`, `done`.
  * FAST PATH (markers): `business_rule` from LAZARUS_RULE, structured per-case `pytest`
    from LAZARUS_ORACLE_JSON.
  * SAFETY NET (deterministic, no markers needed): after migrate() we fetch the agent's
    /workspace/payroll.py via the Files API and emit (a) a real COBOL<->Python `diff` and
    (b) a structured per-case `pytest` by running src/differential_oracle on that module
    vs the real-cobc golden bytes (golden_io.json) — labeled source="differential_oracle"
    so it's never misrepresented as the agent's own test. Business rules fall back to the
    module's real recovered rules. So the demo never looks empty, with or without markers.
Validate the whole live path with `scripts/smoke_test.py` the instant the key exists.

Run:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    export GEMINI_API_KEY=...            # provisioned at the event
    uvicorn server:app --app-dir src --reload
    # open http://127.0.0.1:8000   (UI at /, live by default; ?mock=1 = break-glass)
